      "(2.2) SinceWaiting on 51b27391410efdca841db264df46085fis printed, the current RS is in stopping state(i.e. this.stopping=true). This is the state before we go into stopped state, at this stage we're closing user space regions. The region51b27391410efdca841db264df46085fis still online. tryRegionServerReport() executes.

  "(3) Root Cause": {
    "p": [
      "When RegionServer is going to stop, it fails to connect to current hbaseMaster, and the variable hbaseMaster is set null. In the next round of the while loop, NPE occurs due to calling the instance method of a null object (hbaseMaster).",
      "Since RS aborts, i.e. “Regionserver shutdown improperly”, it leads to “leaves the dir in .old not deleted”. I am not clear what exact “the dir in .old” is, but we know that some directory should have been deleted without this bug."
